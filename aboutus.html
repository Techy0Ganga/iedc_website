                    It is one of the finest platforms for an undergraduate student to get to know the market, different aspects of product building, and more importantly peer-to-peer learning in an open community. I strongly believe growth always depends on the place and time that we are in, in that sense IEDC is the best platform for an undergrad.
                    I had been Chief Executive Officer at IEDC CoET from 2018 to 2019. Takeaways from my IEDC journey are learnings such as how to make connections and healthy relationships in a peer group, how to transform information into knowledge by resharing it, how to handle success and failures, how to pitch an idea on the panel, how should be the thinking process to scale the product on a large scale and how to present it into a larger audience and more independent how to manage finance independently on each phase of product development.

                IEDC CE-Thalassery is one of the best IEDC which holds all the core values of IEDC. Encouraging students to the Leadership, Skill Development, and Entrepreneurship qualities.
                Activities of IEDC TLY are completely controlled by Students with the advice of Nodal Officers and Mentors

                Was I an idiot? Yes, I was!
                How serious was it? Yeah, it was pretty serious!
                I've done a lot of dumb stuff, which I might be ashamed of saying. wasted a lot of opportunities. wasted a lot of my time and the time of others.
                Then what was the purpose? the golden question!
                The "thing" that IEDC taught me is to "be comfortable being an idiot. Stepping out of your comfort zone and being a 'noobie' in a new field is a powerful weapon that can open many doors for you.
                And by helping others and providing value, you grow as a person. It gives you superpowers. (And it may get you income in the future.)
                Yes, I'm grateful for the journey that IEDC has given me, and hosting the first HACKaTLY will be my most cherished memory of the time.
                Hopefully the little ups and downs and lessons we learned will be a wonderful asset for my future endeavors.
                I wish the best for IEDC CETLY for the extraordinary years ahead.
